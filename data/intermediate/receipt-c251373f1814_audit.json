The receipt includes a detailed item '경유(04) 1,678 8X 17.878' with a unit price of 30,000 KRW, and the transaction aligns with the typical operations of a 주유기. Additionally, there is no mention of evening restrictions for fuel purchases, nor are fuel stations typically classified as 주류 판매를 주 목적으로 하는 가맹점 (establishments primarily selling alcohol). Therefore, this transaction does not violate any of the specified regulations.

The absence of a date does not affect the compliance assessment, as there is no regulation prohibiting missing receipt information in this context."
